<h1>Is your website crap?</h1>

<p>It seems a lot of websites for restaurants are created without giving a second thought  to what they're supposed to be for.</p>

<p>Your website should get more people coming to your restaurant. If it doesn't do that then what's the point of it?</p>

<p>We've put together a short guide to help you make your website work for you.</p>

<h3>Guide to getting people from your website into your restaurant</h3>

<p>The most important thing on your website is the words.</p>

<p>Forget pictures, graphics and fancy fonts, your wording needs your attention.</p>

<p>Think of your website as your pitch to your future customer. Your site has to persuade them to want to come and eat in your restaurant.</p>

<p>The thought of writing for your site can be a daunting prospect but luckily there is a tried and tested formula for doing it right..... It's name is AIDA.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Attention</li>
  <li>Interest</li>
  <li>Desire</li>
  <li>Action</li>
</ol>

<p>Use the above to structure your 'pitch'. First say something which will grab their ATTENTION. Once they're listening it's time to make them INTERESTED (perhaps by telling them the benefits of visiting your restaurant). Then create a strong DESIRE in them (you could tell them how popular your place is, what other customers have said about how much they enjoyed their visit) and finally prompt them to take ACTION. That means explaining step by step (even if there's just one step) what they need to do to make a reservation, it needs to be ultra clear.</p>

<p>It has also got to be a bit FUN. This is WAY more important than spelling and grammar.</p>

<p>Writing a story is generally really effective, as is teaching. Look at all the big name chefs. They all have restaurant's and they all teach through TV or their books, they even give their recipes away free online. Teaching keeps people interested and helps to build trust.</p>

<h4>Some details...</h4>

<p>The ideal font to use is size 12 Ariel. It's easy to read and gets reproduced properly on every device (desktop, tablet or phone).</p>

<p>Finally, write in columns. Thinner columns mean that people can read down the page more rapidly. The columns on your site need to be 550 pixels wide max.</p>
